# Warrick's Machine Learning Notebook
Hi! Warrick here :)

This documents my journey to learning ML. 

This will be a combination of algorithms learned from both my course work and side projects. 

I used this to study for my midterms as well :)

2. Linear Regression **(Complete)**

3. k-Nearest Neighbors **(Complete)**

4. Logistic Regression **(Complete)**

5. Naive Bayes **(Complete)**

6. k-Means Clustering **(Complete)**

### Deep Learning (Will upload later :/)
1. Artificial Neural Networks(Complete)

2. Convolutional Neural Networks (Complete)

3. Encoder-Decoder Architectures (Complete)

4. RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs (In Progress) 

5. Transformers (In Progress)

6. GANs

7. GNNs

### Reinforcement Learning 

1. Basics: State, Action, Value Functions

2. Monte Carlo Policy Evaluation 

3. SARSA

4. Q-Learning
